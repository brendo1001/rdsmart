## rdsmart R package

This package is the R implementation of the disaggregating and harmonising soil map units through resampled classification trees (DSMART) algorithm, based on Odgers et al. (2014a, b). The algorithm performs the spatial disaggregation of soil map unit polygons; it spatially predicts the distributions of the soil map unit components.

## Installation

For installation in R the following commands work:

```
# Make sure the devtools package is installed first
install.packages("devtools")

# Load devtools library
library(devtools)

# Install rdsmart from bitbucket
install_bitbucket("brendo1001/dsmart")
```
